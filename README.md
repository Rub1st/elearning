How to launch the app?

Dependencies:
- ruby (v. 2.7.1)
- rails (v. 6.0.3)
- pdftk (necessary for pdf generating gem 'pdf-forms', can be installed with 'apt-get install pdftk')


For launch the app:

1. open console on the project directory and write 'bundle exec rails s'
2. check localhost:3000 in your browser



The most difficult task:

While I was developing this project, I repeatedly encountered difficulties caused by a lack of experience, but perhaps the most difficult of them was working with pdf, or rather their generation. At the moment, I certainly think that this is not so difficult, but at the time I spent a lot of effort on it. I tried to implement this through 3-4 gems before I found a suitable one, which in turn didn't work as expected when installing the add-on, which caused compilation errors and it also took time to solve this problem.


The most interesting task:

To be honest, I can't single out any specific task because of the large number of requirements, many of them seemed useful and interesting to me, among them such as: working with the "devise" gem, using the "active_model_serializers" gem, using " active storage "for storing pdf files and images, implementing impersonation through the" pretender "gem, internationalization in both rails and react, generating pdf files through" pdf-forms " and much, much more.


What could I do if I had more time?

Firstly I would add more tools in admin mode and implement mobile version of site.
Also I think I would optimize backend logic to speed up the project.
